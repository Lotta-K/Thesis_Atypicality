# Thesis_Atypicality

This repository provides all the data and R scripts to replicate the findings and analysis presented in my Master Thesis "Large Language Models and theor failure to draw Atpicality Inferencs"
submitted to Saarland University in August 2024. Additionally,
the Python code for replicating the experiments with any GPT-Model or any model accessible via the ollama library is provided.

To replicate the analysis with the provided data, please start with the R script START.R, which provides all the
necessary libraries that need to be loaded, as well an overview over the different scripts and what analysis they are used for.
This repository contains exemplary code for how the files created with the Python scripts, i.e. the results generated by the LLMs, 
were loaded and processed with and for R. All data provided in the data folder is in the processed form.
