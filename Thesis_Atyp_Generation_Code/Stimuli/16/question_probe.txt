Q2: The second sentence in the direct speech conveys seemingly redundant information, because pre-heating the oven is a usual part of baking a cake. However, since it was mentioned explicitly, it can be assumed that it is new or relevant information. That probably means that Grace doesn't typically pre-heat the oven. What does she do instead?
