You will receive a context (C) and two questions (Q1, Q2).
Answer the questions by rating the frequency on a scale from 0% of the time to 100% of the time. Explain your answer in no more than two sentences. Always give a definitive answer, even if that means making assumptions and speculating based on common knowledge of human behavior.
Additionally, tell me how a person that knows the people mentioned in the context would answer the below questions, using the same scale and explaining their answer in no more than two sentences.
Use the following template for your output, where '<>' is a placeholder for content:
